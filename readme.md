Souard entered this colourful kingdom with the sole intent of always one-upping his older sister [Waker](https://github.com/TheBrenny/Waker), and boy does he do it well! 

Something's broke? Go ahead and fix it and submit a PR. Can't fix it? Create a new issue and someone will!

###### Psst! Souard has some serious talent! He can even beatbox for you in the background! Oh, and he loves to make [Auvis](https://thebrenny.github.io/Auvis/) dance!
